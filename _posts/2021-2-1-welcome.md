**Hey Jon, thanks for sitting down with us today.**<br>
No problem!

**So what's with the new blog and website?  Grand ideas?**<br>
I started to make a portfolio website, and then realized I wanted something that could better showcase my work than just links to code projects or examples.  I wanted something I could "show my work" with, so that's how this became a blog page.

**Anything in particular you plan to blog on?**<br>
Really just about anything I find particularly helpful I can't find an up to date resource on, or my outlook on different resources my consume

**So, like book reports?**<br>
Yeah, exactly like book reports.  I'd expect a fair chunk of my blog to be highlights and responses from different books I read.

**Any topics in particular?**<br>
I'm sure it will be aligned with my professional interests.  So Agile Software Development, Organizational Management, Career Development, and Personal Wealth Management.

**Anything else we can expect to see?**<br>
I'll also be using this site as a place to publish any side projects I'm working on.  I think great software is often made with the demo in mind, so that's in a way what those pages will be.

**Any projects in particular?**<br>
I believe I'll start by creating a post on how I made this website!  Other than that, I wouldn't expect anything linear.  Anything from Python automation of business tools to trying out new cloud tools.

**Sounds like you've got a lot to get working on!  Good luck!**<br>
Thanks, me!
