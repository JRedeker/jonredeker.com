**Hey Jon, thanks for sitting down with us today.**<br>
No problem!

**So it looks like you've created your own personal website, what's all that about?**<br>
Today I launch my personal website, marking my first foray into blogging and establishing some sort of meaningful online presence.  I want it to serve as a resume type site, but also as a blog where I can occasionally post.

**What do you plan on writing about on the blog?**<br>
Well, mainly I want to write guides for some of the things I've spent time figuring out, whether it's programming, personal branding, or something like how I've helped my parents with technology.  I also might mix in some opinion pieces about consumer technology or sports talk (espescially about the NBA and my beloved Chicago Cubs), and probably a bunch more.  I'm looking forward to weaving these things together too.

**What might make your voice an interesting one?** <br>
I've always had a passion for trying to defend the indefensible.  I just like to try and zig when everyone else is zagging.  I think I can do that and deliver it in an entertaining package.
I hope others will find it enjoyable as well.

**How much do you plan on writing?**<br>
Honestly, I don't know.  I don't have any plan for release schedule.  I'm hoping to set up an rss link for anyone who is actually interested in following along.

**Sounds like you've got a lot to get working on.**<br>
I do!  I'll also be linking some of the personal projects I've been working on and making a place on the site for that as well.

**Sure.  Good luck!**<br>
Thanks, me!
