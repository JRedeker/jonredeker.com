My name's Jon Redeker.  I love bad coffee almost as much as I do good coffee.  I'm a resident of Grand Rapids that loves people; espescially my wife, family, and friends.  I'm captivated by sports, space, music, and the human experience.

I do software for a living, helping to shape and educate organizations on how to invest wisely in their applications for maximum ROI and sustainability.  For more info on that, you can find my resume [here]() and my LinkedIn profile [here]({{ site.linkedin }}).  I'm always happy to connect!

Here on my blog, you can find me entertaining the improbable and attempting to solve the impossible.  You can find out more about my intentions of the blog [here]().
